## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is the act of giving yourself a deadline for tasks through your day, and acting as if they are true deadlines. EX: 'I have 5 things to do today. 1 should take 20 minutes, 2 will take an hour, 3 will take 2 hours, 4 will take 30 minutes, and 5 will take 1 hour. If I follow my timeboxing plan, I will be done before lunch is completed."

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

I'll be flexible with how I set my goals. If I'm not to a point I want to be at in a project, I can set another timebox to complete it.

I'll be quick to move on from timeboxes that are over my alloted time. You don't need to spend more time on a task that is completed if you haven't budgeted any more time for it.

I will timebox for the full day if I can. This provides a structure that will make it more difficult to be interrupted when work is important and I won't waste any of my time.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?
