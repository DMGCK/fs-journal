## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

1:1 - Where an item in a database can be embedded in another document, or can be linked by the ID. Embedding is preferred.

1:Many - Think comments on a youtube video, for one video there are many comments. If embedded it can become bad for high write traffic. If linked it is better for high write traffic, as it is technically a separate document.

N:M - where items in the database may have multiple relationships to each other.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Linking lets large documents have relationships with each other, where embedding can have lots of small data be easier to access quickly.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

Some factors that will change your structuring of a database is how many relationships there are, the rate of change, and specificity of categories.
