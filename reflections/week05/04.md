## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

A virtual property is somewhat like an extension of your model. It's not stored in a db the same way, but uses existing properties from the model to create common scenarios.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

The example in the reading is a user's full name. Instead of writing the syntax for writing a full name a bunch of times, you define the Virtual, and run that in stead.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

I don't believe you do, they are not able to be queried or selected.
