## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type: Essentially a primitive with an alias. Cannot change type, and holds simple data.

Reference type: Holds the address of a variable instead of the data itself.

Pointer: Points to an address in memory

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The primitives are value types, but are more specific and varied.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

They are an address in memory that can be manipulated, while still retaining the same space.
