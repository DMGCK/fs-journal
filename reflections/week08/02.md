## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Without communicating effectively, everyone could work over each other, be ineffective, could be doing anything they want all day.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

I don't think we had to make too many adjustments ourselves.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

Pick 2! Whatever you choose, you will sacrifice one key element. It takes longer, but was done cheaply and effectively. It was amazing and fast, but super expensive. It sucks, but it was cheap and quick.
