## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit tests, Component tests, end to end tests.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

Component testing will be important, as if the components don't work together the way they are supposed to, everything explodes.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Unit tests in this case would most likely be least useful, the functionality is rather simple so far.
