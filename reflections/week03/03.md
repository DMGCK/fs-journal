## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

a get or a set handler. They make sure everything moving through the proxy is allowed to do so.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

returning the thing they asked for, if you do not it will be undefined.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

If you don't want data of one kind to be moved, removed, or added, then your proxy can say "no, don't do that."
