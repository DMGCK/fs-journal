## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation keeps code organized in the long run. as applications can get larger and larger, knowing exactly where this thing that does only X that's broken is will help a lot in figuring out where something breaks when everything breaks.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

The underscore prefix is usually used for things that the external user of the API in question really isn't supposed to use, and can change more often. If those funcs break from the first party, it SHOULDN'T break a bunch of stuff if you don't use them as a third party. If you do, it might break it all :)

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

You use block scoping to your advantage, by placing it inside the class. This can reduce "surface area" for malicious actors to intrude on your data / inner workings.
