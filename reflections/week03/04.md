> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?



The observer pattern is a way to not have to write a billion update calls in every function. It avoids having state management be a nightmare! 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

An object being observed 

an object that observes the designated Observed object,

then how they communicate.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.


If the proxystate sees you add a piece of data, it asks if it's a valid property, and if so, gives you the value of that property. 

If you set a property in the proxystate, it checks if it's a valid property, sets the key value pair if it is, I'm not 100% sure how emit works, and allows you to complete the set.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Classes rock, and MVC can be nice in simpler projects. Components will become a part of normal use later as well.
