## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Not being able to access different classes and variables through different files in the system.

2. How does export differ from export default?

Default export is limited to one per file, and cannot have any other names. Export is more descriptive and can have many different names to represent many different values.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Modules, being separate JS files that have different purposes, keep concerns between funcs separate, and data from being in the wrong hands *as easily*
