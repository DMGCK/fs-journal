> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Nested functions, anonymous functions (esp if used multiple times), no separation of concerns.


2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

async functions are functions that do not necessarily run in top down order, where a function can call another function written later in the codebase to handle errors or certain situations. These callback functions run, then it goes back to the function that called the function that invoked it. These are usually called in the arguments of a function

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

name your functions - helps with parsing dense information when something goes wrong!

Separate your functions - this helps separate your concerns and makes it easier to use them again later.

no nested code if you can help it! - the deeper your functions are the more difficult they are to read.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

async doesn't necessarily need to be difficult to understand, but retrofitting a current program for async functionality (esp with an API) is a pain. Get your data figured out FIRST.
