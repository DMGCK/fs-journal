## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is a unique ID for the table you are working with. Foreign keys are primary keys of another table, allowing a Relationship to be established.

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is used to give a sql column or table a temporary name.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorsPatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT 
dp*,
p*
FROM doctorsPatients dp
JOIN patients p ON p.doctorId = @id 
WHERE dp.doctorId = @id

```
