## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Pseudo classes seem to be actions the user can take, such as hovering over an element and changing the properties of such element. Classes, on the other hand describe the properties of objects in the "first place." Pseudo classes would then describe how they change, with classes describing the actual element in the document.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a system that helps resolve conflicts between multiple rules that target the same properties on the same objects in the DOM. Using the selector type and placement in the system of rules, css ** should ** be predictable in how each object in the DOM is styled.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

In the words of the great movie villain Syndrome, of the Incredibles, "If everyone's super, then no one is super."

In other words, if something marked as important suddenly is not the most important element on the page, the other rules that might be starting to affect it will not work.
