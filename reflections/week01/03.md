## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Color choice and subtle box shadows do so much, and it's really nice to have some guidelines and reminders to how that works and best practices.


2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

JHS pedals website "https://www.jhspedals.info/"

lots of space, some fun parallax scrolling, it's very reserved with color choice on the actual site itself, but the photography is vibrant and wonderful.

Discord - LOTS of information all at once, presented neatly with solid visual choices.

Lots of music equipment sites have really evocative art and design (not retailers).

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

It shows the "coolness" of your product, and represents the feeling it should bring to you. Cold and clinical, to vibrant, fun and loud. All this is from color choice and visual choices.
