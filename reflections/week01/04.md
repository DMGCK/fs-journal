## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

The purpose of wire framing is to focus your design on how the user will interact with it, keeping both your goals and the user's goals aligned. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The different levels of detail are as follows: low, medium, and high fidelity.

Low is easy, quick and cheap to rough draft ideas as quickly as possible. Usually ends up being on pen/paper.

Mid fidelity translates the pen/paper to the computer, with large scale moves and few details.

High fidelity moves into a more complete version of what the UX would be with a complete app, with details and 'feel' of the site more accurately represented.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Every single time a wireframe will be worth the time and effort. Even just mocking up a website that I'm looking at is relatively difficult, but without a plan I would be totally lost.
