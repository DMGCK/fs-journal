## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

The purpose of wire framing is to focus your design on how the user will interact with it, keeping both your goals and the user's goals aligned. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The different levels of detail are as follows: low, medium, and high fidelity.

Low is easy, quick and cheap to rough draft ideas as quickly as possible. Usually ends up being on pen/paper.

Mid fidelity translates the pen/paper to the computer, with large scale moves and few details. This step starts to get the feel right, but might not be exactly there.

High fidelity moves into a more complete version of what the UX would be with a complete app, with details and 'feel' of the site more accurately represented.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Every single time a wire frame will be worth the time and effort. Even just mocking up a website that I'm looking at is relatively difficult, but without a plan I would be totally lost.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

There is a lot of effort that goes into designing a website to make sure each piece works well together. Tools like figma make it easier for visual people to keep palettes together, to visualize how a site will flow and change. Html, CSS, and bootstrap alone will get you all the way, but it will take longer without tools and good planning.
