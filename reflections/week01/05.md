# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I think that my understanding of CSS selectors leveled up **significantly,** and bootstrap only assisted in making the progress faster. I enjoy how quickly bootstrap lets me work with websites.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

Not much was a shock or suprise this week, I have spent a decent amount of time with HTML and Bootstrap. It has been fun watching others struggle and overcome some of the same issues I have in the past, and much faster. Out of necessity? Maybe.

- What are you struggling with?

I am not currently struggling with much in class, but my sleep schedule has been historically bad. I've spent the last month waking up early to practice, and the expectation of being here each day has helped a lot. I will sometimes wake up before my alarm it seems because I really feel the need to be here.

- What would you count as a victory?

The fact that I'm here at all. I want to work hard and learn as much as I can before I have to leave here, and improve my life going forward.
