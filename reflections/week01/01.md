## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git is a tool that lets multiple developers work on the same "base" of code, saving multiple versions and handling conflicts between developers. Without Git, we would be emailing builds back and forth and our email inboxes would be awful.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple branches allow for features to be experimented with while the main or public side of the project can stay "unbroken." Essentially, your experiments aren't a totally new install of whatever software you're building, but a self contained project with room for error.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Github is a tool for visualizing and storing the remote repository, and allowing other developers to collaborate with projects that are not yet locally on their machine. 

Git is the tool that actually facilitates the files moving between machines, publishing, branching, merging, pushing, etc. Github would be empty if Git wasn't around.

## Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Label your push/commits with intent, and an informative bent. a poor example would be "commit 1," where a better example would be "id selector update," etc etc.
