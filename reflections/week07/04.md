## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

To be honest I didn't really implement any of these principles, I was a lot more focused on functionality.

2. What went well this week?

I finally feel like I'm clicking with backend. A lot of trials and broken bearer tokens and gremlin unexpected tokens later, and I feel like I'm really gelling with backed. Vue is a similar story.

3. What would you do differently?

I would be a little bit slower, I moved really fast this week and didn't really spend the time on the journals I really needed to.
