## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

SOLID, Vue, Yelp API, Google Maps API, geolocator

2. What went well so far?

I enjoy my team a lot, and our planning session was a lot of fun. We did have a lot of 'it would be cool ifs though'

3. What would you do differently? Why?

Not a lot. I might have been a bit more hesitant to do badges, but the scope of the app was already limited.
