## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope decides where variables are available for use, with Global and Local being the 2 scopes usually available. 

Global variables are A: declared outside of functions and other statements and B: available for use in any function or statement.

Local variables are declared inside some kind of statement, and are then local to that statement, only being able to used there.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is the practice of moving a variable to the highest point in its scope. If the variable is not declared before it is called within its scope, it will behave as if it is not declared at all.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Constant is the easiest, it needs to not change.

Var VS Let is a different discussion. Let does everything that var does and a little bit more. The main draw to let is block scoping, where any group of {} that a let variable is declared inside of will be considered the variables scope.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

objects are super powerful!! I like being able to smash objects inside of objects, then access them with obj.property.prop2.prop3, it *can* be much easier than using arrays of objects.
