## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

1: function ```*functionName*(arg) {
  function code
}```

2: anonymous

``` 
.method(alias => {function})

used with methods that *for example* iterate through arrays or objects and do *something,* where that something is your function in combination with that method.
```

Method construction is the newest way to declare a function I've learned about. Inside an object or class (?) you can describe a function by its name and arguments, then the {actual function} inside curly braces. ex below.

```
object {
  stuff: [],
 funct(...index) {
  stuff it atually does
  }}

or

class x {
  getThing(thing) {
    stuff happen;
    return stuff;
  }
}
```


2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are aliases to functions, like how *x* => is the alias for the lambda function. The arguments are the actual values.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?


A higher order function is a function that accepts functions as parameters, and/ or returns a function. 

a function that takes the operation that you are needing into it, *along with the values your processing* is going to be the kind of thing we're thinking about here.

The more abstracted (single concern function) your code is, it can be easier to do more different things with simple bases.
