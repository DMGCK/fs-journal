# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Javascript is great fun, I don't feel like I forgot everything I knew. I learned a lot of data tricks that will make my life a lot easier going forward. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

There weren't too many suprises this week, I am sure next week will be different. I have already spent a decent amount of time with JS.

- What are you struggling with?

I am struggling with keeping the scope of my functions single concern. I really like having abstracted functions but they usually end up just doing "*everything I think they should do*."

- What would you count as a victory?

How well Taylor and I worked together, and that we recognized each other in that moment.
