## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

When you have a plan, you have a better idea of what is and is not necessary as you work on your project. If you research your plan and keep its scope reasonable, your decisions you make can be more beneficial to the project in the long run.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

First find out what part of the code is making you stuck, look at documentation for that piece of work, and make some changes. If after fiddling with that code with the help of the documentation doesn't get you anywhere, get some help.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Fail early, fail often. If your function isn't broken in some way after a couple lines of code, either it's a very small case, or it illuminates the next couple changes you need to make to it.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

When working as a group on this project, we planned a little bit before we really got working. Taylor and I got on the same page very quickly, we talked a lot about how to implement certain functions and bounced ideas off of each other quickly and often. 

If we hadn't communicated as effectively, this project would have been much more difficult. By a mile.
