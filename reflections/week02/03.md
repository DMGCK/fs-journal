## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

There are 3 ways to have things written to the console. 

1: The programmer can write it to the console manually with console.log(), which can write anything you need it to, wherever you need it to.

2: If you are working with an API or similar, when something goes wrong with the API, it will console log an error message. This should tell you what kind of thing went wrong, and where. Usually, this will happen at runtime, when it has a chance to see the error.

3: The system will console log an error if something goes wrong as well! Use a method on an object of a different type? That's an error. Didn't declare your function as a function? Go find it and fix it.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab will show you html and css (without comments). The tools on the right side of the console can be very nice for debugging as they let you see your changes in real time and have options for fine tuning CSS.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?


Using the debugger is a way to track where and what your values and functions are doing, step by step, stopping the processor from blasting through it in milliseconds. Watching it step by step and reading variables is a powerful tool for finding where things go wrong

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

be careful how you structure your data in JS, you treat an array of objects very differently than you would treat an object of arrays. Most of my trouble with this assignment was handling the data.
