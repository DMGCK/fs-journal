```

**2.** The `SPA` acronym stands for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single page application
```
**3.** What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
SP apps are fast, are very good for smaller applications due to their client side loading of each page, instead of sending a new request to the server to load a new page.
```
**4.** What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Whenever a component or page is mounted, it runs whatever code is in that method.
```
**5.** What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?

V-model lets you bind data from some input on your page to the scripting for its component.
```
**6.** The `v:on` (`@`) directive can be used for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
@event lets you make pieces of your components listen for events easily and simply.
```
**7.** Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
V-if and v-show let you render based on conditions in your scripting.
```
**8.** What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The key attribute gives each piece of your repeated components a unique ID that lets Vue keep track of all of them
```
**9.** What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?
